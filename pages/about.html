      <h3>Geospatial Developer</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Boineelo, which means Dedication. I hold an M.Sc in Geoinformatics and a double major BA in Environmental Sciences and Archaeology – a unique mix, I know! I’m a dedicated geospatial developer and a certified Environmental Practitioner with the 
        <a href="https://eapb.org.bw" target="_blank">Botswana Environmental Assessment Practitioners Board (EAPB)</a> as well as a professional archaeologist registered with the Botswana National Museum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at the <a href="https://www.thuenen.de/en/institutes/rural-studies/staff/technical-staff/moyo-boineelo-m-sc" target="_blank">Thünen Institute</a> in Germany, 
        where I’m immersed in transforming raw alphanumeric and geospatial data into harmonized, structured datasets for scientific research.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m passionate about applying cutting-edge geospatial techniques to address global challenges like climate change and sustainable resource management.
