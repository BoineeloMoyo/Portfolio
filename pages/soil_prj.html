                <h2>Introduction & Objectives</h2>
                <p>This project employed the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) to model soil erosion in the 
                    Cibodas Biosphere Reserve, West Java, Indonesia. The study analyzed the impact of rainfall, 
                    terrain, and land use on soil degradation, focusing on the region's diverse slopes and 
                    elevation-dependent rainfall patterns. The model gives an estimate of the total amount of soil loss resulting 
                    from sheet or rill erosion per hectare per year. By integrating environmental and anthropogenic factors, 
                    the project identified areas with high potential and actual soil loss, providing insights into sustainable 
                    land management practices in erosion-prone regions.</p>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>To understand the distribution and accessibility of green free spaces and their significance to
                    happiness in suburbia, the following methodology was adopted, </p>
                    <div class="methodology">
                    <ul>
                        <li>R-Factor (Rainfall Erosivity):
                            Rainfall erosivity index was calculated with a regression analysis using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) tool 
                            to measure the intensity of rainfall and its runoff potential and its dependence on elevation. </li>
                        <li>K-Factor (Soil Erodibility):
                            The K-factor assesses soil susceptibility to erosion, based on soil characteristics. Soil data were joined 
                            with K-factor values, and the resulting polygons were converted to raster. </li>
                        <li>SL-Factor (Topographic Factor):
                            The SL-factor evaluates the influence of slope length and steepness on erosion. Contour lines were 
                            converted to raster, and slope was generated, followed by low-pass filtering to reduce noise. </li>
                        <li>C and P Factors (Crop and Management Factors):
                            C and P factors reflect land-use impacts on soil erosion. Provided CP values were joined with 
                            land-use data and converted to raster for analysis. </li>

                    Annual rainfall per year was calculated as: Prainfall = - 365,875.5281 â€“ 2.026832X + 0.041915Y + 0.0674449Z. 
                    After getting P, the R-factor was calculated using the formula: R = 38.5 + 0.35P

                    The analysis suggests that forests dominate the green spaces, contributing significantly to the local ecosystem.
